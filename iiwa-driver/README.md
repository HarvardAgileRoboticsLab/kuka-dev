# drake-iiwa-driver

This repository contains the application code used to communicate with
the KUKA iiwa are from Drake.  Communicating with the arm requires two
pieces, a Java application to run on the KUKA Sunrise cabinet, and an
local C++ application communicating with the cabinet using the FRI
protocol.

The KUKA control cabinet has two network interfaces which are
configured with static IP addresses.  Both will need to be connected
to communicate with the arm.

 * X66: 172.31.1.147/16 -- This interface is used by Sunrise Workbench to load new software onto the controller.
 * KONI: 192.170.10.2/24 -- This is the interface which FRI clients communicate over.  That's not in the reserved IP space, so it could potentially cause a conflict if you happen to want to contact a host in that subnet.

Selecting the command mode to use for the arm (position vs. torque) is
done by starting a different Java application on the arm
(DrakeFRIPositionDriver vs. DrakeFRITorqueDriver).  The C++ driver
will detect which mode the FRI connection is in and send commands
appropriately.

## Sunrise Workbench

Provisioning the IIWA arm must be done from Sunrise Workbench.

The computer running Sunrise Workbench must be configured with an
address which can communicate with 172.13.1.47/16, and which is
connected to the X66 port.

TODO(sam.creasey) Can I just zip up a project/workspace?

 * File -> New -> SunriseProject
  * IP address of the controller can be left at 172.31.1.147
  * Create new project
  * Project Name: DrakeFRIDriver
  * Topology template: LBR iiwa 14 R820
  * Media Flange: Medien-Flansch Touch pneumatisch
  * Create Application
  * Source folder: whatever
  * Package: drake_fri
  * Name: DrakeFRIDriver

 * In "Package Explorer", select StationSetup.cat
  * Software (leave anything checked which already is, I think)
   * Direct Servo Motion Extension (might not be needed?)
   * Fast Robot Interface
   * Smart Servo Motion Extension
  * Save (Ctrl-S)

 * In "Package Explorer", select SafetyConfiguration.sconf
  * Customer PSM
   * Uncheck row 1 "External EMERGENCY STOP"
   * Uncheck row 2 "Operator Protection",
   * Uncheck row 3 "Safety Stop"

 * Copy in kuka-driver/DrakeFRIPositionDriver.java and kuka-driver/DrakeFRITorqueDriver (make sure Sunrise sees the update, you may need to import the files into the project) in DrakeFRIDriver/src/drake_fri/  You can remove any exising DrakeFRIDriver.

 * In "Package Explorer", select StationSetup.cat
  * Installation
    * Push "Install" (this will not actually install the application, but it will wipe the existing configuration of the KUKA cabinet and replace it with yours).  It will take a few minutes, and eventually will reboot the controller.

 * Press the "sync" button.  It's on the toolbar at the top, 5th from the right.  It looks a bit like a square with a couple of arrows over it (though it doesn't look much like this).  This will install the application.
  * Execute

## C++ driver

Once Sunrise Workbench is provisioned, you'll need to configure the
system which will communicate directly with the KONI interface.  This
system must be configured for the IP address 192.170.10.200 (netmask
/24, or 255.255.255.0). KUKA recommends directly attaching the
computer to the KONI port instead of using a switch.

On the SmartPad, turn the key switch, and choose the "AUT" mode, then turn
the key switch back. Choose either "DrakeFRITorqueDriver" or "DrakeFRIPositionDriver"
from "Application". Press the green "Play" button on the left sidebar of the SmartPad.

Next, build the driver program to communicate with the iiwa arm using
FRI, and with the controlling application using LCM.  Compiling this
project will output a single program in the build directory called
"kuka_driver".  Running it with no arguments will connect to the IIWA
at it's default address and port (192.170.10.2, port 30200), negotiate
LCM into the command state, and report the IIWA status via LCM.  If no
LCM control messages are received, the arm will be in a "limp" state
where it can be moved externally subject to the configured impedence
force (hardcoded in the Java application).  Once it receives a command
via LCM, that position (and optionally torque) will be commanded until
the next LCM position is received.

An application wishing to control the arm should listen to LCM for
status updates and command the joints appropriately in response.
